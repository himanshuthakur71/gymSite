				<p>Our model at FITNESS ACADEMY is anchored around two fundamental concepts.</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-4">
					<li>
						<strong
							>First, that a customized fitness program delivers better results for every
							individual.
						</strong>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong
							>Second, that there is power in community. When athletes train together, in small
							groups, encouragement and camaraderie builds consistency.
						</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Our “FITNESS ACADEMY” concept is centered around member happiness and results. We are
					proud that we have become San Francisco’s fastest-growing personalized training and sports
					performance gym. We have pioneered a way to provide top-notch professional fitness
					training and a customized and personal approach to meeting fitness goals for a wide-array
					of clients, ranging from youth to retirees and fitness novices to professional athletes.
				</p>

				<p>
					FITNESS ACADEMY was founded on the success of a few clients and built on the successes of
					countless others. We want to change Bay Area lives and lifestyles for the better. We hope
					you’ll become a part of our community of fitness enthusiasts and athletes and begin your
					own journey towards feeling “even better” by experiencing the AFITNESS ACADEMY difference.

					At FITNESS ACADEMY, we believe everyone should have access to a professional expert when
					it comes to their health and especially when it comes to fitness. We are the standard
					bearers for excellence in fitness in the Meetli Village, District Baghpat of Division
					Meerut .
				</p>

				<p>
					Our vision at FITNESS ACADEMY is to deliver to you all the benefits of a personal trainer
					(without the higher costs and scheduling hassles) enhanced by a highly-supportive
					environment of coaches, mentors and members. Think of us as your own personal team of
					athletic coaches.
				</p>

				<p>
					Whether your objective is better fitness, strength, getting trim or just stress management
					and overall wellness, we will design a personalized roadmap to get you there. And we like
					to be innovative and so your workout will be too. We’ll create a variety of conditioning
					and strength-based training programs, that are constantly fresh every week, just for you.
					We know a set of new (and sometimes unexpectantly surprising) workouts is the secret to
					staying motivated.
				</p>

				<p>
					We offer semi-private workouts and team training sessions as well as personal training
					options. Check out our <a href="/memberships" class="link-hover link-primary"

					We are not just a gym. We are not a club. We are a welcoming (couple – Robbi and Leo) and
					community – in the heart, and with the heart of Baghpat.
				</p>
				<p>
					That means everyone at FITNESS ACADEMY knows everyone else on a first name basis (and we
					worry about you if you miss your training session). We truly care. You are not a number.
					You are a valued member of our family. Whether you are a fitness newbie, a play-hard,
					work-hard busy professional or a high school athlete, we treat everyone with respect. We
					are non-judgmental and highly inclusive.
				</p>

				<p>
					From our trainers to our members, we cultivate a positive and supportive culture. Our
					members tell us that we are organized, focused, efficient, high-quality and committed. And
					energized, motivating, encouraging, flexible and supportive. But we’re particularly proud
					that they also say we’re caring, passionate, fun and friendly.

				<p>
					Our members say our complete-body workouts really challenge them. And since we are adamant
					about consistency, we do try to be a bit “habit-forming” (but in a good way). We know
					motivation is key when it comes to working out.
				</p>
				<p>
					We’re proud to report that we rarely lose a member unless they move out of the area or for
					some reason can’t workout anymore for other reasons.
				</p>
				<p>
					We hold ourselves accountable to high standards when it comes to athletic performance but
					we also believe in a 360-degree more holistic perspective when it comes to wellness. From
					nutrition to stress management, breathing to hydration, we make sure it’s all in focus at
					FITNESS ACADEMY.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our focus is on health, fitness and performance over appearance. Progress over perfection.
					But the bottom line is that our individualized routines and fitness programs are designed
					to deliver the specific results you seek. And they do. When we ask our members if they
					would recommend us to others, on a scale of zero to 10, our net promoter score is 9.2. But
					don’t listen to us, browse our <a href="/" class="link-hover link-primary"
